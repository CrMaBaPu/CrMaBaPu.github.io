# Study Design

> [Note !] This chapter was  mainly formulated on information provided by the AVR Porject documentation. 

The resulting dataset captures multimodal physiological and behavioral data in response to emotionally evocative VR stimuli.

## Overview

The experimental pipeline consists of several sequential phases:

1. **Pre-Survey**
2. **Setup**
3. **Resting State (Pre)**
4. **Training**
5. **Experiment**
6. **Resting State (Post)**
7. **Post-Survey**

### 1. Pre-Survey

Participants begin by completing a pre-survey assessing their baseline mood, demographic information, and individual differences in emotional traits.

### 2. Setup

Participants are instrumented with a range of biosensors to monitor:

* EEG (electroencephalogram)
* ECG (electrocardiogram)
* PPG (photoplethysmogram)
* GSR (galvanic skin response)
* Respiration belt
* Eye tracking

### 3. Resting State (Pre)

Participants undergo two resting-state conditions:

* Eyes Open
* Eyes Closed

This baseline data provides a physiological benchmark for comparison with task-related responses.

### 4. Training

Participants are introduced to the **Flubber** interface in VR, a dynamic rating tool used to continuously report their affective state (valence and arousal) during the experiment.

* **Valence**: Negative to Positive
* **Arousal**: Low to High
* The Flubber pulsates (slow/fast) and changes shape (regular/irregular) to reflect arousal and valence.

### 5. Experiment

Participants experience a sequence of emotionally charged VR scenarios (e.g., spaceship, invasion, asteroids, underwood). During the entire session:

* They use a handheld VR controller to continuously rate their emotional state via the Flubber interface.
* At the end of the session, participants provide summary ratings for each scene.

### 6. Resting State (Post)

The resting state procedure is repeated (eyes open and closed) to observe any post-experiment physiological shifts.

### 7. Post-Survey

A final survey is completed, collecting subjective feedback and post-session emotional self-assessment.

## Data Description

The dataset derived from this experiment includes:

* **Physiological Signals**: EEG, ECG, PPG, GSR, respiration, and eye tracking
* **VR Controller Data**: Continuous Flubber ratings of valence and arousal
* **Survey Data**: Pre/post emotional states, participant demographics, and scene-specific ratings
