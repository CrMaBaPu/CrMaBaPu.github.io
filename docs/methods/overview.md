# Initial Exploration of EEG Embeddings

The goal phase of this project focused on exploring neural embeddings learned from **preprocessed EEG data** using the [CEBRA](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/cebra) (Contrastive Embedding for Behavioral and neural Representation Analysis) framework. 

This project consists of two main stages focusing on learning meaningful neural embeddings from EEG data:

1. **Initial Exploration:**
This stage involves unsupervised learning of neural embeddings from preprocessed EEG recordings of a single subject using the CEBRA framework. The goal is to understand the latent structure of EEG signals and investigate effects such as channel selection and temporal dynamics in a low-dimensional embedding space.

2. **Advanced Modeling:**
The second stage will build upon the initial findings by developing a more complex model incorporating multi-subject and/or multimodal data. This phase aims to learn shared neural representations that generalize across sessions and subjects
