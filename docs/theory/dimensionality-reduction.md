# Why CEBRA for EEG Analysis?

Raw EEG data has:
- **High dimensionality**: 64 channels
- **Temporal resolution**: high number of samples per second

This creates challenges:
- **Visualization**: Impossible to directly visualize high-dimensional spaces
- **Interpretation**: Difficult to understand patterns in high dimensions
- **Computation**: Increased computational complexity

### Advantages for EEG Data

1. **Temporal resolution**: High sampling rates capture fast neural dynamics
2. **Spatial coverage**: Multiple electrodes provide simultaneous recordings
3. **Functional relevance**: EEG signals reflect large-scale brain activity
4. **Task sensitivity**: Clear relationships between brain states and behavior

### Challenges in EEG State Space Analysis

1. **Volume conduction**: Signals from different brain regions mix at electrodes
2. **Reference effects**: Choice of reference electrode affects all channels
3. **Artifacts**: Eye movements, muscle activity, and electrical interference
4. **Individual differences**: Anatomical and functional variations between subjects

When analyzing EEG data from multiple subjects, we face:

- **Different anatomies**: Varying brain structures and electrode positions
- **Individual differences**: Unique patterns of brain activity
- **Alignment challenges**: How to compare states across subjects


## 1. Temporal Structure Preservation

EEG data has rich temporal dynamics that traditional methods often struggle to capture. CEBRA's ability to use temporal auxiliary variables makes it particularly suitable for:

- **State transition analysis**: Understanding how brain states evolve over time
- **Sequence learning**: Capturing temporal dependencies in neural activity
- **Event-related dynamics**: Linking neural responses to specific task events

## 2. Multi-Subject Generalization

In your multi-session EEG analysis, CEBRA's consistency principle enables:

- **Cross-subject comparisons**: Identifying shared neural patterns across individuals
- **Population-level insights**: Understanding common brain dynamics
- **Individual difference analysis**: Quantifying how subjects differ in their neural responses

## 3. High-Dimensional Data Handling

EEG recordings typically involve:
- **Many channels**: 64, 128, or more electrodes
- **High sampling rates**: Thousands of samples per second
- **Complex spatial patterns**: Interactions between different brain regions

CEBRA efficiently handles this complexity by learning compact representations that preserve the most important information for your research questions.

## Biological Interpretability

The embeddings learned by CEBRA often correspond to:

- **Neural population states**: Coherent patterns of activity across neurons
- **Behavioral modes**: Different phases of task execution
- **Cognitive states**: Attention, memory, decision-making processes
- **Temporal dynamics**: State transitions and sequence information

This interpretability makes CEBRA particularly valuable for neuroscientific research, where understanding the biological meaning of the results is crucial.
This theoretical foundation provides the basis for understanding how CEBRA can reveal shared neural dynamics across your multi-session EEG recordings, enabling insights into the common patterns of brain activity that underlie cognitive and behavioral processes.
