# Why CEBRA for EEG Analysis?

Raw EEG data has:
- **High dimensionality**: 64 channels
- **Temporal resolution**: high sampling rate (number of samples per second)
- **Complex spatial patterns**: Interactions between different brain regions

This creates challenges:
- **Visualization**: Impossible to directly visualize high-dimensional spaces
- **Interpretation**: Difficult to understand patterns in high dimensions
- **Computation**: Increased computational complexity

## Advantages 

1. **Temporal resolution**: High sampling rates capture fast neural dynamics
2. **Spatial coverage**: Multiple electrodes provide simultaneous recordings
3. **Functional relevance**: EEG signals reflect large-scale brain activity
4. **Task sensitivity**: Clear relationships between brain states and behavior

## Challenges 

1. **Volume conduction**: Signals from different brain regions mix at electrodes
2. **Reference effects**: Choice of reference electrode affects all channels
3. **Artifacts**: Eye movements, muscle activity, and electrical interference
4. **Individual differences**: Anatomical and functional variations between subjects

When analyzing EEG data from multiple subjects, we face:

- **Different anatomies**: Varying brain structures and electrode positions
- **Individual differences**: Unique patterns of brain activity
- **Alignment challenges**: How to compare states across subjects?

## CEBRA with EEG Data

### 1. Temporal Structure Preservation

EEG data has rich temporal dynamics that traditional methods (UMAP, PCA)  cannot capture. CEBRA's ability to use temporal auxiliary variables makes it particularly suitable for:

- **State transition analysis**: Understanding how brain states evolve over time
- **Sequence learning**: Capturing temporal dependencies in neural activity
- **Event-related dynamics**: Linking neural responses to specific task events

### 2. Multi-Subject Generalization

In a multi-session EEG analysis, CEBRA's consistency principle enables:

- **Cross-subject comparisons**: Identifying shared neural patterns across individuals which helpt with the understanding of common brain dynamics
- **Individual difference analysis**: Quantifying how subjects differ in their neural responses

### Biological Interpretability

The embeddings learned by CEBRA might correspond to:

- **Neural population states**: Coherent patterns of activity across neurons
- **Behavioral modes**: Different phases of task execution
- **Cognitive states**: Attention, memory, decision-making processes
- **Temporal dynamics**: State transitions and sequence information

This theoretical foundation provides the basis for understanding how CEBRA can reveal shared neural dynamics across a multi-session EEG recordings, enabling insights into the common patterns of brain activity that underlie cognitive and behavioral processes.
