# Neural State Space Analysis

## Conceptual Framework

**Neural state space analysis** is a mathematical framework for understanding brain activity as trajectories through a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents the activity of a neural population or brain region. In the context of EEG analysis, this approach treats the electrical activity recorded from different electrodes as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space. EEG recordings capture electrical activity from multiple brain regions simultaneously, giving us a window into these dynamic brain states

## State Space

A **neural state** at time is defined as the pattern of activity across all recorded neural units. The different activity patterns of the brain can respond to: 
- Attention states
- Decision-making states
- Motor preparation states
- Cognitive load states

### Neural Dynamics as Trajectories

Brain activity over time can be viewed as a **trajectory**  through the state space. This trajectory captures:
- **Instantaneous states**: Brain activity at specific moments
- **Transitions**: How the brain moves between different states
- **Temporal structure**: The ordered sequence of states over time

### Discrete vs. Continuous States

Neural states can be conceptualized as:

1. **Discrete states**: Distinct, stable patterns of activity
   - Decision states, attention states, motor preparation states
   - Characterized by clustering in state space
   - Transitions between states are relatively rapid

2. **Continuous states**: Smoothly varying patterns of activity
   - Gradual changes in attention or arousal
   - Characterized by smooth trajectories in state space
   - Transitions are gradual and continuous

## Dimensionality and Manifold Structure

### Neural Manifolds

Despite the high dimensionality of neural data, neural activity could lie on **lower-dimensional manifolds**:

This manifold structure arises because:
- **Correlated activity**: Neural populations act together
- **Functional constraints**: Brain activity serves specific computational purposes
- **Anatomical connectivity**: Physical connections limit possible activity patterns

### Shared Manifold 

The **shared manifold hypothesis** suggests that despite individual differences, there exists a common low-dimensional space that captures:
-**Universal neural computations**: Common brain processes across individuals
-**Task-related dynamics**: Shared patterns of state transitions
-**Cognitive states**: Common modes of brain activity

This theoretical framework provides the foundation for understanding how neural state space analysis can reveal the shared patterns of brain activity across a multi-session EEG recordings, enabling insights into the common cognitive and neural processes that underlie human behavior.
